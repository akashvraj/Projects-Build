A utility to get jenkins job console logs in local terminal.

Real time logs for ongoing build.

Notification on completion.

Use logging [info], [warn], [debug], [action], [error], [fatel] at the start(in between terms also supported - experimental) to distinguish different lines visually.

Note> Use terminal with good scrollback capacity to run this.
